Package providing tools for testing L4 applications.

libgtest and libgmock are provided as the basic test libraries. They
can be used in both host and target mode, making it possible to write
both, functional tests and basic target-independent unit tests.
The host versions are currently not build but can be enabled gmock/Makefile
and gtest/Makefile, respectively.

In addition, the /atkins directory contains utils and fixtures specifically
for the L4Re environment.
