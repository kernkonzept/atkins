 *
 *  Tests for L4Re are written using the testing framework Atkins. Atkins
 *  is an adaptation of the gtest framework for the L4Re platform.
 *
 * Command Line Options
 * -------------------
 *
 * Tests written using Atkins accept a number of command line switches. In
 * addition to the normal switches accepted by gtest programs the following
 * switches are interpreted by Atkins:
 *
 *  + `-v` sets the output verbosity. The argument may be specified multiple
 *    times to be more verbose.
 *  + `-r` instructs Atkins to output the properties set for each test.
 *  + `-b` tells Atkins to reboot the system after the test finishes.
 *    Rebooting only works for tests that use the main function from Atkins
 *    through `#include <l4/aktins/tap/main>`. The functionality requires that
 *    the test has the Platform_control capability or the switch will have no
 *    effect. If the test aborts before the main function is reached (e.g.
 *    through the ned script) or if the test does no terminate the system will
 *    also not reboot.
 *
 * Test specific command line arguments
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 * A test can register its own command line arguments with Atkins. To do so,
 * the test must register the argument name and a callback with either
 * Atkins::Cmdline::Manager::register_option or
 * Atkins::Cmdline::Manager::register_flag.
 *
 * The registration must be performed before the main function runs. To do so,
 * the registration calls should be done in the constructor of an object. The
 * object then must be statically constructed.
 *
 *     #include <l4/atkins/tap/main>
 *
 *     static void set_value(char const *) {...}
 *
 *     ...
 *
 *     namespace {
 *       struct Foo
 *       {
 *         Foo()
 *         {
 *           using namespace Atkins::Cmdline;
 *           L4Re::chksys(cmdline()->register_flag(
 *                          'e',
 *                          Manager::Req_arg,
 *                          set_value,
 *                          "Optional help text"),
                          "Cannot register 'e:' flag with cmdline\n");
 *         }
 *       };
 *
 *       static Foo __foo;
 *     } // namespace
 *
 *
 * Alternatively, a test can write its own customised main(). In this case
 * the register calls must be done before invoking
 * Atkins::Cmdline::Manager::parse.
